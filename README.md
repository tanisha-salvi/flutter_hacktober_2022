# Campus OLA üöï

People often try to search for others who are also leaving for airport/railway station from IITG campus during vacations, trips etc because solo cab booking will cost high and they tend to look for others who are also leaving at same date & time and can divide the fare accordingly. Campus OLA will help people in finding cab partners via interactive searching, creating search posts etc.
